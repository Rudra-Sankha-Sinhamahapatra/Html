<p><b>Artificial intelligence (AI)</b> is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated 
by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by non-human animals or by humans. Example tasks in which this is 
done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings
 of inputs.

    AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems 
    (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars 
    (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, 
    and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).[1]
    
    As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the
     definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.[2] For instance, optical character recognition is
      frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.[3]
    
    Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since it has experienced 
    several waves of optimism,[4][5] followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"),
    [6][7] followed by new approaches, success, and renewed funding.[5][8] AI research has tried and discarded many 
    different approaches, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large 
    databases of knowledge, and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly
     mathematical and statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly
      successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.[8][9]
    
    The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. 
    The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural 
    language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects.[a] General intelligence 
    (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals.[10] To solve these problems, 
    AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and
     mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, 
     probability, and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, 
     and many other fields.
    
    The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine
     can be made to simulate it".[b] This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical
      consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously 
      been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity.[12] Computer scientists and philosophers have 
      since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered 
      towards beneficial goals.[c] The term artificial intelligence has also been criticized for overhyping AI's
       true technological capabilities.[13][14][15] </p>
